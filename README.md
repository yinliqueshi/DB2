## TASKS
In this assignment, you will implement Indexed Nested Loop Join. I will explain:
* How to setup the code.
* What code you should implement.

## Setup and Environment
1. Installation
    1.  Setup Java environment, and add java to path. This repo built on JAVA8. 
        *   [Download Official JDK HERE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
        *   OpendJDK is another choice.
    2.  This project use Apache Maven for package management. Install Maven if you need.
        *   [Installation Guide](https://maven.apache.org/)

2.  Code Setup
    1.  Clone Repo From Github.
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/berkeley-cs186/Sp19HW2.git
    ```
    
    2.  Compile and Run Tests.
        ```
        cd DB2
        mvn clean
        mvn compile
        mvn test
        ```
        You will see there are total 152 tests, and you will get 32 errors. You don't need to worry about this, 
        there errors indicate the place you should implement your code.
        

## Getting Familiar with the Code
Navigate to the `src/main/java/` directory. You will find seven directories: 
`common`, `database`, `databox`, `io`, `table`, `query` and `index`.
You do not have to deeply understand all of the code, but since all future programming assignments will reuse this code, it's worth becoming a little familiar with it. 
**In this assignment, though, you may only modify files in the `index`, `query`, and `test/java/query/` directory**.

### common
The `common` directory contains miscellaneous and generally useful bits of code
that are not particular to this assignment.

### databox
The `databox` directory contains the classes which represent the values
stored in a database, as well as their types. Specifically, the `DataBox` class
represents values and the `Type` class represents types. Here's an example:

    ```java
    DataBox x = new IntDataBox(42); // The integer value '42'.
    Type t = Type.intType();        // The type 'int'.
    Type xsType = x.type();         // Get x's type: Type.intType()
    int y = x.getInt();             // Get x's value: 42
    String s = x.getString();       // An exception is thrown.
    ```

### io
The `io` directory contains code that allows you to allocate, read, and write
pages to and from a file. All modifications to the pages of the file are
persisted to the file. The two main classes of this directory are
`PageAllocator` which can be used to allocate pages in a file, and `Page` which
represents pages in the file. Here's an example of how to persist data into a
file using a `PageAllocator`:
    
    ```java
    // Create a page allocator which stores data in the file "foo.data". Setting
    // wipe to true clears out any data that may have previously been in the file.
    bool wipe = true;
    PageAllocator allocator = new PageAllocator("foo.data", wipe);
    
    // Allocate a page in the file. All pages are assigned a unique page number
    // which can be used to fetch the page.
    int pageNum = allocator.allocPage(); // The page number of the allocated page.
    Page page = allocator.fetchPage(pageNum); // The page we just allocated.
    System.out.println(pageNum); // 0. Page numbers are assigned 0, 1, 2, ...
    
    // Write data into the page. All data written to the page is persisted in the
    // file automatically.
    Buffer buf = page.getBuffer(transaction);
    buf.putInt(42);
    buf.putInt(9001);
    ```

And here's an example of how to read data that's been persisted to a file:

    ```java
    // Create a page allocator which stores data in the file "foo.data". Setting
    // wipe to false means that this page allocator can read any data that was
    // previously stored in "foo.data".
    bool wipe = false;
    PageAllocator allocator = new PageAllocator("foo.data", wipe);
    
    // Fetch the page we previously allocated.
    Page page = allocator.fetchPage(0);
    
    // Read the data we previously wrote.
    Buffer buf = page.getBuffer(transaction);
    int x = buf.getInt(); // 42
    int y = buf.getInt(); // 9001
    ```

### table
In future assignments, the `table` directory will contain an implementation of
relational tables that store values of type `DataBox`. For now, it only
contains a `RecordId` class which uniquely identifies a record on a page by its
page number and entry number.
    
    ```java
    // The jth record on the ith page.
    RecordId rid = new RecordId(i, (short) j);
    ```

### query
The `query` directory contains what are called query operators. These are operators that are applied to one or more tables, or other operators. They carry out their operation on their input operator(s) and return iterators over records that are the result of applying that specific operator. We call them “operators” here to distinguish them from the Java iterators you will be implementing.

`JoinOperator` is the base class that join operators you will implement extend. It contains any methods you might need to deal with tables through the current running transaction. This means you should not deal directly with `Table` objects in the `Query` directory, but only through methods given through the current transaction.

### index
The `index` directory contains a partial implementation of a B+ tree
(`BPlusTree`), an implementation that you will complete in this assignment.
Every B+ tree maps keys of type `DataBox` to values of type `RecordId`. A B+
tree is composed of inner nodes (`InnerNode`) and leaf nodes (`LeafNode`).
Every B+ tree is persisted to a file, and every inner node and leaf node is
stored on its own page.

## Implementation

### B+ Tree
The `index` directory contains a partial implementation of a B+ tree
(`BPlusTree`), an implementation that you will complete in this assignment.
Every B+ tree maps keys of type `DataBox` to values of type `RecordId`. A B+
tree is composed of inner nodes (`InnerNode`) and leaf nodes (`LeafNode`).
Every B+ tree is persisted to a file, and every inner node and leaf node is
stored on its own page.

In this assignment, do the following:

1. Read through all of the code in the `index` directory. Many comments contain
   critical information on how you must implement certain functions. For
   example, `BPlusNode::put` specifies how to redistribute entries after a
   split. You are responsible for reading these comments. If you do not obey
   the comments, you will lose points. Here are a few of the most notable
   points:
    - Our implementation of B+ trees does not support duplicate keys. You will
      throw an exception whenever a duplicate key is inserted.
    - Our implementation of B+ trees assumes that inner nodes and leaf nodes
      can be serialized on a single page. You do not have to support nodes that
      span multiple pages.
    - Our implementation of delete does not rebalance the tree. Thus, the
      invariant that all non-root leaf nodes in a B+ tree of order `d` contain
      between `d` and `2d` entries is broken. Note that actual B+ trees **do rebalance**
      after deletion, but we will **not** be implementing rebalancing trees in this project
      for the sake of simplicity.
3. Implement the `get`, `getLeftmostLeaf`, `put`, and `remove` methods of
   `InnerNode` and `LeafNode`. For information on what these methods do, refer
   to the comments in `BPlusNode`. Don't forget to call `sync` when
   implementing `put`, and `remove`; it's easy to forget.
4. Implement the `get`, `scanAll`, `scanGreaterEqual`, `put`, and `remove`
   methods of `BPlusTree`. In order to implement `scanAll` and
   `scanGreaterEqual`.

After this, you should pass tests in the index folder we have provided to you.


### Index nested loop Join
The `query` directory contains a fully implementation of nested loop join and a partial
implemented Index nested loop join.

In this assignment, do the following:

1. Read through the code of `QueryOperator`, `SNLJOperator`. They contain critical information on how to Implement INLJ.
2. Read through the code of `SequentialScanOperator` and implement `BtreeScanOperator`。
3. Then Implement the `iterator` function in INLJ, you will need scan the btree here, so finish the `BtreeScanOperator` before INLJ.

### Tests Two table join and three table join.
Test your Index Nested Loop Join. We provide you three csv files in the root directory, 
courses.csv, students.csv, and enrollments.csv.

In this assignment, do the following:

1. Load data from csv, created table and build btree. Implement `loadEnrollment`, `loadCourse`, and `loadStudent` 
in `test\java\query\TestINLJ.java`

2. Join Student and enrollment. Implement `testINLJ_SJoinE` function.
The function is partially implemented. The comments in the function contains the steps you should do, it works as a guideline.
Finish the function and print both schema and result to console.
The result should contains 1000 tuples.

3. Join Student, enrollment and Course. Implement `testINLJ_SJoinEJoinC` function.
The function is partially implemented. The comments in the function contains the steps you should do, it works as a guideline.
The result should contains 1000 tuples. You can reuse your code in question 2.
